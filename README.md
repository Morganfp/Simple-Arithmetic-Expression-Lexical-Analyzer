# Simple-Arithmetic-Expression-Lexical-Analyzer
A program that implements a lexical analyzer (lexer) for simple arithmetic expressions. The lexer reads an input file containing arithmetic expressions and breaks it down into a sequence of tokens, each representing a valid expression element such as an integer, operator, or parenthesis and a sequence of lexemes.
